ðŸŒ¸ Mood Bloom â€” Fidget Flower Keychain
Mood Bloom is a flower-shaped wearable PCB designed as a calming, interactive fidget keychain for emotional expression and anxiety relief. Each petal features an LED that lights up when its corresponding switch is pressed, representing different moods. When the device detects fidgeting (via a light sensor), the LEDs begin to flicker, and a vibration motor provides gentle haptic feedback â€” creating a soothing, sensory interaction.
